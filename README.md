# ðŸ‘‹ Introducing EyePop.ai: 
## A Self-Service AI Platform designed to make it easy for people of all technical levels to create apps based on Computer Vision AI.

## Computer vision is a technology that enables machines to interpret and act upon visual data, like photos or videos, making it possible for them to perform tasks that require visual recognition. Think of the possibilitiesâ€”products that adapt to user uploaded content, instant demographic data based on visual media, or real-time analysis of live streams for audience engagement metrics.
